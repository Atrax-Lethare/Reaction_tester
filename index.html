            This is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">REACTION TESTER</span> . <br>
            We will be giving you the data of your reflexes,<br> based on the records of your reaction times, <br>
            in the following game. <br><br>
            <span id="instructions">: INSTRUCTIONS :</span> <br><br>
            Click on the box that appears on the screen as fast as you can. <br>
            This will calculate your reaction time <br>(from when the box is visible to when you will click it). <br>
            Finally, an average reaction time will be awarded as aresult of the test. <br>
            As you click on OK (that pops up on the screen from the top), <br> you will keep getting new boxes. <br><br>
            <div id="suggestion">* You can use this game to keep regularly <br> checking if your reaction time is omproving or not.</div> <br><br>
